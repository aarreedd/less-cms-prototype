# \*Less CMS Prototype

This is a headless, serverless, git-based CMS with a simple, static REST API.

After spending a day researching headless CMSs, I could not find exactly what I want. So I build this prototype. Feedback welcome!

## Workflow:

1) Edit markdown files locally
2) Push to git
3) Trigger build and deploy to static file hosting service (Cloudflare pages, Github Page, S3, etc)
4) Retrieve content through simple API

## Why?

1) Decouple content from your main code base
2) Store content centrally, dispaly anywhere (website, app, etc)
3) Practically free to operate
4) Fast and simple (and fun!)
5) No database, serverless, git-based

## Features

- SEO friendly
- Supports images ([how to get images to work properly?](#how-to-get-images-to-work-properly))
- Supports basic search/filtering (should handle thousands of posts without issue)
- Supports categories
- Supports authors
- Supports recent posts
- Supports pagination

## How it works

The build script:

1) Copies all the markdown files and assets to the distribution directory
2) Parses all [FrontMatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/front-matter) info in the markdown files and coverts to json and stores it in the distribution directory
3) Creates a [manifest.json](https://less-cms-prototype.pages.dev/manifest.json) file which allows you to list and filter posts easily

That's it. Now deploy it to a [static file hosting service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-anything/) and you have a simple JSON API to retrieve all of your content from.

## Example Pages

- [manifest.json](https://less-cms-prototype.pages.dev/manifest.json)
- authors
    - [alan.json](https://less-cms-prototype.pages.dev/authors/alan.json)
    - [alan.md](https://less-cms-prototype.pages.dev/authors/alan.json)
- posts
    - [post-one.json](https://less-cms-prototype.pages.dev/posts/post-one.json)
    - [post-one.md](https://less-cms-prototype.pages.dev/posts/post-one.md)
    - [post-two.json](https://less-cms-prototype.pages.dev/posts/post-two.json)
    - [post-two.md](https://less-cms-prototype.pages.dev/posts/post-two.md)
- assets
    - img
        - [logo.png](https://less-cms-prototype.pages.dev/assets/img/logo.png)

## Tips

- Use GitHub as your writing environment. You can preview markdown and images will be display properly.
- Use relative paths for linking to images and assets. For example, use `../assets/logo.png` instead of `/assets/logo.png`. This ensures that images display correctly both in GitHubâ€™s Markdown previewer and on your website.
- Match markdown file paths with website URLs. For example, if your CMS will be hosted at `www.example.com/blog`, store your markdown files in `/blog/*.md`.

## How to get images to work properly?

To ensure images display correctly on your website, set up a redirect from `www.example.com/assets/*` to `cms.example.com/assets/*`. You can rename the assets directory to avoid conflicts with your existing site.
